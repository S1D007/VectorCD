# VectorCD

## Overview

**VectorCD** is an automated Continuous Deployment tool designed to streamline the deployment process of applications across test and production environments. It allows teams to efficiently manage and deploy different components of an application, such as the frontend and backend, by leveraging a Git branching strategy. This tool aims to minimize dependency issues between teams and ensure a smoother workflow.

## Key Features

- **Automated Deployment**: Automatically deploy applications to staging and production environments based on your Git branches.
- **Environment Management**: Separate environments for staging and production, enabling safe testing and deployment.
- **Seamless Integration**: Integrates smoothly with your existing Git workflow.
- **Test Links**: Automatically generate test links upon merging PRs, allowing teams to test their components in a live environment without needing local setups.
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Facilitates collaboration between frontend and backend teams by providing a shared environment where both teams can test their components independently.

## Use Case Scenario (This is just an Example)

Let's assume you have two branches in your Git repository:

- **staging**: Used for the latest PRs created by your team.
- **production**: Used for the final PRs that are ready to go live.

In your organization, you have two sets of developers:

1. **Frontend Team**: Working on the UI part of the application.
2. **Backend Team**: Working on the API and business logic.

### Example Workflow

1. The backend team completes the API and merges their PR into the `staging` branch.
2. The frontend team needs to test the UI but also requires the API to be available. They can use the test link generated by VectorCD for the `staging` environment to test their UI against the latest API.
3. Once both the UI and API are confirmed to be working, the final PR is made from `staging` to `production`.
4. VectorCD then deploys the application to the production environment.

This workflow ensures that both frontend and backend teams can work independently while still collaborating effectively.
